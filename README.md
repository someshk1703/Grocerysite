# Grocerysite
I have created a grocery site using Html Css and Javascript 
It consist of a html css js file
Look into comment section in html to understand the code , as i've used class name , id in relation to every section of the site
it would make you to have better understanding about the code 
css has repeatative code in every section which required similar design structure having a brief usnderstanding over 
class heading and tags will help you very much .
